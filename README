cid distribution v0.2

xcid requires X, obviously (pure Xt).
Edit the makefile if not on FreeBSD to comment out -DSPEAKER.
This is pretty hackish. For some debug stuff in either xcid or cidserv, use -DDEBUG in CPPFLAGS.

Updates:
There is now cnd_mgetty, for use with mgetty's cnd-command parameter. No changes in the client are needed for this to work. To use it, change the ADDRS define at the top.
===========
xcid can now use xosd (and libxosd). If you don't want to do this, remove -DUSE_XOSD and -lxosd from xcid/src/Makefile.
===========
parselog.pl now works with the new logfile format. Have a blast with it, but the verbose output can get annoying without a pager.
